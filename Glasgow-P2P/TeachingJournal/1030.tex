As this was my first tutoring session, I was very excited, but I also did not know what to expect, and whether I will enjoy it or not. Luckily, I overall did enjoy it. Being a workshop, It was a 30-minute session, which is good for a first session. The biggest inconvenience from the session was that I did not have a print-out of the solutions to the questions, which was not a problem for a \emph{how do I do this?} sort of question, but was a problem for the \emph{what's the final answer?} questions - which were actually more common than the former. I, thus, did my best to scan the student's questions for errors rather than check the final answer to infer whether they've made any mistakes or not, and answer them based on that. At one point, I was not able to answer one such question because of the lack of the answer sheet, but I looked it up on my phone afterwards while the students were answering the assessed workshop questions in the second half, and told the student the answer after then.
