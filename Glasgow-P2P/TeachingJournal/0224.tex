Today's questions were on Optics and Classical and Quantum Waves. Trying these questions out before the tutorial I found out that there is a big gap in difficulty between Optics (very hard) and CQW (very easy). Interestingly, I was only asked questions about the CQW, although I tried to encourage the students to attempt the Optics questions, but they seemed to be very put off by the difficulty. I strongly think that a solution should be thought of in regards to this. Either by only including a smaller number of more difficult questions, so that it is not very frustrating for the students if they are not able to solve them, or by only including a large number of easier questions that are more varied and cover a larger part of the material. I think the latter would be more fun and helpful for the students.
