\paragraph{}

Since I have attended both morning and noon sessions of the P1 Tutorial on this day, I will write up a single entry for both, as this will allow me to compare and contrast them in a better way.

\paragraph{}I noticed today that a lot more people asked questions in the noon session rather than the morning session. Either because students are much more awake in the afternoon rather than 9 in the morning (I can vouch for that from personal experience as a student), or because us, the tutors, were more awake, and therefore, more inviting in regards to questions. Perhaps even because the students usually go through the questions directly before the tutorial, so having a tutorial in the afternoon gives them more time to prepare their questions. I also noticed that students were more involved in going through the questions in the morning session, which comes in support of the latter.
