Nothing much happened today. Since students take about 15 minutes to read and try out the questions, this only leaves them another 15 more minutes to ask us questions since the second half is dedicated for the assessed workshop questions. However, a few interesting things that happened were that one of the other tutors and I engaged in a discussion about one of the questions to try and better explain it to the students; and that one tutor asked me to try and give an alternative explanation to one of the students' questions - it was, however, algebra that the student did not fully understand the first time around, so after breaking it up into smaller steps they were able to understand it.

This led me to think whether having more than one teacher in a regular class would have a positive impact; and reminded me of a class last year where we had a guest co-lecture for some of the classes. I think that helped a lot to see things from two different perspectives.
