\paragraph{}

This was the first 2nd-semester tutorial for me. Questions from students seem to be on the decline. I am not sure if the reason for this was whether this is the time of the year when students study much more as exams are approaching, or because this is the time when the students' enthusiasm and attendance decline. I will assume the former, though, mainly because when checking with students' they usually seem to have done the right things.

Most students asked about, or have gone through, only the first question, but to be fair it was the longest and most time-consuming. I noticed that usually those type of questions are always put at the start -- I am not sure if this is the best way to arrange them, as I believe diversity in questions makes up for a better understanding than spending too long on a single question.
