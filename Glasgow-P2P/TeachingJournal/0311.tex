Today, the students spirits were not very high, with a number of them sitting in the back, watching videos on their computers, and waiting for the assessed part of the workshop. Some were paying a lot of attention, however. Most of the questions were about the particle physics part, on topics such as baryon number conservation, which the students seem to find very confusing. I do remember that I found it confusing in my first year as well, so it is not very surprising. This indeed falls in the same sort of topics as the quantum mechanics that I talked about in the last journal entry, that is hard to explain other than to say \emph{an electron has a baryon number of zero, and there's nothing more I can say at this point.} So perhaps, there might be a need to find a new way to reintroduce sophisticated topics to first year students in a novel way.
