\paragraph{}
This was an observed session. Surprisingly, I do not think that added any pressure. (I believe this is because I was observed by a peer rather than a senior - I wonder how it would change if it was otherwise.)

I was asked about a mechanics question first, in which I was successful after some effort to lead the students to the answer on their own. I was then asked a quantum mechanics question, which I found very hard to explain without getting deep into 3rd year concepts and complicated mathematics. After some time trying to lead the student to the answer, they seemed completely clueless about what I was saying, I ended up reminding them of the relevant equations, which is probably how they are taught quantum mechanics in first year. This makes me unsure whether quantum mechanics should enter the 1st year curriculum at all. Looking back at this point from my own perspective at my university education, I would perhaps argue that it should not. Lastly, I was asked about a past paper question, which caught me by surprise. Luckily, the student had already had a good starting point so thinking my way through up from that I was able to explain the question and leading them to the answer.
