Today was my first \emph{second year} physics tutorial. I was more prepared as I printed out the solutions. I was also quite familiar with the topics today. There were a lot of tutors present; probably too many, as at any moment, half of us were doing nothing. Halfway through I decided to go around and ask people specifically if they have questions - it turned out that most of them actually do have questions, but perhaps they were too shy to ask.

There were some mistakes that we pointed out at the start of the tutorial. There was also a mistake in the solutions, almost everyone was confused so we worked together to figure it out.

All in all it was a successful tutorial and I am at the same level of enthusiasm as I was last week. Next week I have 4 sessions, I also have an exam, but I hope that this wouldn't affect my performance and that I will be able to prepare well for all of them.
