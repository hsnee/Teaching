This was the second P2 tutorial, and I still stand by the statement I made earlier that I enjoyed P2 tutorials over P1 ones; I believe because both the curriculum is still sort of relevant, and the academic maturity of the students is also closer to ours.

I don't know personally any physics 1 students but have some friends in physics 2 whom I sensed that they were more comfortable asking me questions, although I tried to give equal attention to both students whom I already know and students whom I don't

 I was also asked a question that was not in the tutorial questions, which I think I handled fine, as the Physics 2 material still seems relevant to my studies in fourth year -- at least a lot more so than Physics 1 material.
