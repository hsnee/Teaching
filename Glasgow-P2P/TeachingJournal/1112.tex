Being a 2nd year direct entrant to the University of Glasgow, I have not had experienced this type of tutorials before as a student, so this was my first exposure to this type of tutorials. The student:tutor ratio was very close to one so every tutor was mostly helping one of the students, and therefore there were longer and more meaningful questions. The longer interaction also helped with actually leading the students to the answer to discover it on their own, which proved more difficult than first expected in the other tutorials.
