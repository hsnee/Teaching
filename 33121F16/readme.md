# 33-121 Fall '16 Readme 
This folder contains miscellanious files from the course 33-121: Physics I for Science Students in Fall '16 that I TAed. Main resources for this course can be found in www.husni.space, in the Evaluations folder in this repo, or in https://github.com/hsnee/Jupyterize33121, where I work on rewriting the computer labs for the course.
