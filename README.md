# Teaching


  * I created this repository as:
1. a teaching portfolio 
2. a collection of resources that I use in teaching
3. resources that I aim to use to improve
4. complete list of personal documents and excerpts from courses that I taught/TAed.

Some of these are password protected. Some of those that are not are either work-in-progress or resources available publicly at the Eberly Center's website (http://eberly.cmu.edu), but if for some reason you would like access let me know.
