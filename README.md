# Teaching
I created this repository as (a) a teaching portfolio, (b) a collection of resources that I use in teaching, (c) resources that I aim to use to improve and (d) complete list of personal documents and excerpts from courses that I TAed.

Most of these are password protected. Most of those that are not are either work-in-progress or resources available publicly at the Eberly Center's website (http://eberly.cmu.edu), but if for some reason you would like access let me know.
